# Exercise 1.11

A function $f$ is defined by the rule that

$$
f(n) =
\begin{cases}
n                      & \text{if } n < 3    \\
f(n−1)+2f(n−2)+3f(n−3) & \text{if } n \ge 3
\end{cases}
$$

Write a procedure that computes $f$ by means of a recursive process. Write a
procedure that computes $f$ by means of an iterative process.
