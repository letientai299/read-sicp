# Exercise 1.12

The following pattern of numbers is called _Pascal’s triangle_.

```
         1
       1   1
     1   2   1
   1   3   3   1
 1   4   6   4   1
       . . .
```

The numbers at the edge of the triangle are all 1, and each number inside the
triangle is the sum of the two numbers above it. Write a procedure that computes
elements of Pascal’s triangle by means of a recursive process.

## Answer

Let's define $P(r, c)$ as the function to compute the value at row $r$ and
column $c$ in the Pascal's triangle.

$$
\forall
r \in \mathbb{N}
\text{, }
c \in \mathbb{N}
\text{, }
c \le r
\qquad
P(r, c) =
\begin{cases}
0                        & r \gt c \\
1                        & c = 0 \text{ or } c = r \\
P(r-1, c) + P(r-1, c-1)  & \text{otherwise} \\
\end{cases}
$$

With that defined clearly, we can implement the tree-recursive version easily.

It's not hard to find the closed-form $P(r, c) = \binom{r}{c}$ (it's called
[Binomial Coefficient][binom]), which can be implemented as a linear recursive
solution.
