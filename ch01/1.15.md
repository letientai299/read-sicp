# Exercise 1.15

The sine of an angle (specified in radians) can be computed by making use of the
approximation $sin x \approx x$ if $x$ is sufficiently small, and the
trigonometric identity

$$
sin x = 3 sin \frac{x}{3} - 4 sin^3 \frac{x}{3} \tag{sin3x}
$$

to reduce the size of the argument of $sin$. (For purposes of this exercise an
angle is considered "sufficiently small" if its magnitude is not greater than
0.1 radians.) These ideas are incorporated in the following procedures:

```racket
(define (cube x)
  (* x x x))
(define (p x)
  (- (* 3 x) (* 4 (cube x))))
(define (sine angle)
  (if (not (> (abs angle) 0.1))
      angle
      (p (sine (/ angle 3.0)))))
```

1. How many times is the procedure `p` applied when `(sine 12.15)` is evaluated?
2. What is the order of growth in space and number of steps (as a function of
   $a$) used by the process generated by the `sine` procedure when `(sine a)` is
   evaluated?

## Note

$(sin3x)$ formula can be derived by using the sum trigonometric identify

$$
sin(\alpha + \beta) = sin(\alpha) cos(\beta) + cos(\alpha) sin(\beta)
$$

## Answer

Because $12.15 / 3^5 = 0.05 \lt 0.1$, `p` is evaluated 5 times.

In general, the number of times when `p` is evaluated are $log_3(x / 0.1)$. The
following procedure compute that value:

```racket
(define (count-calls x)
  (ceiling (log (/ x 0.1) 3)))
```

`(sine x)` either returns or call _once_ to itself with $x/3$ as argument, then
pass the value to `p`. Call tree won't expand to multiple nodes within each
layer. Thus, $\Theta_{space}(1)$.

From the previous question, we know that the depth of the tree, i.e. order of
growth in time, is $\Theta_{time}(log(a))$
