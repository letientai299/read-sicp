# Exercise 1.20

The process that a procedure generates is of course dependent on the rules used
by the interpreter. As an example, consider the iterative `gcd` procedure given
above.

Suppose we were to interpret this procedure using normal-order evaluation, as
discussed in 1.1.5. (The normal-order-evaluation rule for `if` is described in
[Exercise 1.5](./1.5.md).) Using the substitution method (for normal order),
illustrate the process generated in evaluating `(gcd 206 40)` and indicate the
`remainder` operations that are actually performed. How many `remainder`
operations are actually performed in the normal-order evaluation of
`(gcd 206 40)`? In the applicative-order evaluation?

## Answer

```racket
(define (gcd a b)
  (if (= b 0) a (gcd b (remainder a b))))
```

### Normal order

Expands, then evaluate. However, `if` is short-circuited, so the condition part
will always be executed before either branches expands. There will be 18
executions of `remainder`:

- 14 times in `if` condition.
- 4 times to get the final result.

```racket
> (gcd 206 40)

> (if (= 40 0)
    206
    (gcd 40 (remainder 206 40)))

> (if (= (remainder 206 40) 0)
    (remainder 206 40)
    (gcd (remainder 206 40)
         (remainder 40 (remainder 206 40))))
; remainder executions = 1

> (if (= (remainder 40 (remainder 206 40)) 0)
    (remainder 40 (remainder 206 40))
    (gcd (remainder 40 (remainder 206 40))
         (remainder (remainder 206 40)
                    (remainder 40 (remainder 206 40)))))
; remainder executions = 3

> (if (= ;
     (remainder (remainder 206 40)
                (remainder 40 (remainder 206 40)))
     0)
    (remainder (remainder 206 40)
               (remainder 40 (remainder 206 40)))
    (gcd (remainder (remainder 206 40)
                    (remainder 40 (remainder 206 40)))
         (remainder
          (remainder 40 (remainder 206 40))
          (remainder (remainder 206 40)
                     (remainder 40 (remainder 206 40))))))
; remainder execution = 7

> (if (= (remainder
        (remainder 40 (remainder 206 40))
        (remainder (remainder 206 40)
                   (remainder 40 (remainder 206 40))))
       0)
    (remainder (remainder 206 40)
               (remainder 40 (remainder 206 40)))
    (gcd (remainder
          (remainder 40 (remainder 206 40))
          (remainder (remainder 206 40)
                     (remainder 40 (remainder 206 40))))
         (remainder
          (remainder (remainder 206 40)
                     (remainder 40 (remainder 206 40)))
          (remainder
           (remainder 40 (remainder 206 40))
           (remainder (remainder 206 40)
                      (remainder 40 (remainder 206 40)))))))
; remainder execution = 14
; if condition is true, so it won't continue to expand gcd.
; its 1st branch will be evaluated, adding 4 more remainder executions.
```

### Applicative order

Evaluate args, then expands. `remainder` performs 4 times.

```racket
> (gcd 206 40)

> (if (= 40 0) 206
    (gcd 40 (remainder 206 40)))

> (gcd 40 (remainder 206 40))

> (gcd 40 6)

> (if (= 6 0) 40
    (gcd 6 (remainder 40 6)))

> (gcd 6 (remainder 40 6))

> (gcd 6 4)

> (if (= 4 0) 6
    (gcd 4 (remainder 6 4)))

> (gcd 4 (remainder 6 4))

> (gcd 4 2)

> (if (= 2 0) 4
    (gcd 2 (remainder 4 2)))

> (gcd 2 (remainder 4 2))

> (gcd 2 0)

> (if (= 0 0) 2
    (gcd 0 (remainder 2 0)))

> 2
```
