# Exercise 1.22

Most Lisp implementations include a primitive called `runtime` that returns an
integer that specifies the amount of time the system has been running (measured,
for example, in microseconds).

The following `timed-prime-test` procedure, when called with an integer $n$ ,
prints $n$ and checks to see if $n$ is prime. If $n$ is prime, the procedure
prints three asterisks followed by the amount of time used in performing the
test.

```racket
(define (timed-prime-test n)
  (newline)
  (display n)
  (start-prime-test n (runtime)))
(define (start-prime-test n start-time)
  (if (prime? n)
      (report-prime (- (runtime)
                       start-time))))
(define (report-prime elapsed-time)
  (display " *** ")
  (display elapsed-time))
```

Using this procedure, write a procedure `search-for-primes` that checks the
primality of consecutive odd integers in a specified range. Use your procedure
to find the three smallest primes larger than 1000; larger than 10,000; larger
than 100,000; larger than 1,000,000. Note the time needed to test each prime.
Since the testing algorithm has order of growth of $\Theta(\sqrt{n})$, you
should expect that testing for primes around 10,000 should take about
$\sqrt{10}$ times as long as testing for primes around 1000.

Do your timing data bear this out? How well do the data for 100,000 and
1,000,000 support the $\Theta(\sqrt{n})$ prediction? Is your result compatible
with the notion that programs on your machine run in time proportional to the
number of steps required for the computation?

## Answer

Below table contains some primes with the digits increase from 4 to 10 and the
stats in nanoseconds for both `prime?` and `fast-prime?`. `fast-prime?` is
configured to always use 100 tries.

For unknown reasons (perhaps due to Racket GC, or noisy machine), there's some
outliers in the stats. That said, we can see that `primes?` time roughly
increase 3 times for every 1 more digit, which is $\sqrt{10}$ (3.16227766017),
as expected.

For `fast-prime?`, the time should growth logarithmic due to how `expmod` works.
As $log_2(a^2) = 2log(a)$, we should have the time for 9 digits to be twice of
the time for 5 digits ($1e8 = 1e4^2$). We can confirm that from the data.

Also notice that `fast-prime?` is much slower when the number is small, because
it does much more computation than `prime?`. Only after the number get big
enough, it starts to be beat `prime?`.
