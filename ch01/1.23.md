# Exercise 1.23

The `smallest-divisor` procedure shown at the start of this section does lots of
needless testing: After it checks to see if the number is divisible by 2 there
is no point in checking to see if it is divisible by any larger even numbers.
This suggests that the values used for `test-divisor` should not be 2, 3, 4, 5,
6, …, but rather 2, 3, 5, 7, 9, …. To implement this change, define a procedure
`next` that returns 3 if its input is equal to 2 and otherwise returns its input
plus 2. Modify the `smallest-divisor` procedure to use `(next test-divisor)`
instead of `(+ test-divisor 1)`. With `timed-prime-test` incorporating this
modified version of `smallest-divisor`, run the test for each of the 12 primes
found in [Exercise 1.22](./1.22.md).

Since this modification halves the number of test steps, you should expect it to
run about twice as fast. Is this expectation confirmed? If not, what is the
observed ratio of the speeds of the two algorithms, and how do you explain the
fact that it is different from 2?

## Answer

Original time complexity of `smallest-divisor` is $\Theta(\sqrt{n})$. The
improvement should be $\Theta(\sqrt{n}/2)$. So the expected performance increase
is 200%, new algorithm should take only 50% to complete.

My implementation (in [`./prime.rkt`](./prime.rkt)) is a bit different with what
described in the exercise description. I check if `n % 2 == 0` in
`smallest-divisor-next` first, then start `find-divisor-next` with 3 and always
increase the `test-divisor` by 2. So, the code doesn't need to check
`if n%2 == 0` everytime. I guess at the time the book is written, evaluating
that `if` everytime was so costly, causing the result is much less than 200%.
