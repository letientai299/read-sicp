# Exercise 1.25

Alyssa P. Hacker complains that we went to a lot of extra work in writing
`expmod`. After all, she says, since we already know how to compute
exponentials, we could have simply written

```racket
(define (expmod base exp m)
  (remainder (fast-expt base exp) m))
```

Is she correct? Would this procedure serve as well for our fast prime tester?
Explain.

## Answer

The change causes terrible performance decrease because the amount of
computation and the input provided to `remainder` are very large compare to the
old one. Given that `fast-prime?` is often used against very large number, where
`prime?` is too slow to complete, this new `expmod` implementation is not
suitable for it.

| Prime | `expmod` | `expmod-expt` | Diff     |
| ----- | -------- | ------------- | -------- |
| 1009  | 143      | 13295         | 9197.0%  |
| 1013  | 163      | 62706         | 38370.0% |
| 1019  | 162      | 29444         | 18075.0% |
| 1021  | 170      | 24532         | 14331.0% |
| 1031  | 120      | 36497         | 30314.0% |
