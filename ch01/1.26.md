# Exercise 1.26

Louis Reasoner is having great difficulty doing [Exercise 1.24](./1.24.md). His
`fast-prime?` test seems to run more slowly than his `prime?` test. Louis calls
his friend Eva Lu Ator over to help. When they examine Louis’s code, they find
that he has rewritten the `expmod` procedure to use an explicit multiplication,
rather than calling `square`:

```scheme
(define (expmod base exp m)
  (cond ((= exp 0) 1)
        ((even? exp)
         (remainder
          (* (expmod base (/ exp 2) m)
             (expmod base (/ exp 2) m))
          m))
        (else
         (remainder
          (* base
             (expmod base (- exp 1) m))
          m))))
```

“I don’t see what difference that could make,” says Louis. “I do.” says Eva. “By
writing the procedure like that, you have transformed the $\Theta(log n)$
process into a $\Theta(n)$ process. Explain.

## Answer

This part would evaluate `expmod` twice in each iteration. change it from a
linear recursion to a tree recursion.

```scheme
(remainder
  (* (expmod base (/ exp 2) m)
     (expmod base (/ exp 2) m))
  m)
```

The depth of the call tree is still $log(n)$. However, the total steps of the
call to `expmod` become $2^{log(n)} =  n$. Thus, the time change to $\Theta(n)$.
