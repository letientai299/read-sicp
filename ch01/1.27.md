# Exercise 1.27

Demonstrate that the Carmichael numbers listed in Footnote 47 really do fool the
Fermat test. That is, write a procedure that takes an integer $n$ and tests
whether $a^n$ is congruent to $a$ module $n$ for every $a < n$, and try your
procedure on the given Carmichael numbers.

## Answer

See `fool-fermat-test` in [`./prime.rkt`](./prime.rkt).
