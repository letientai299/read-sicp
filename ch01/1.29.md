# Exercise 1.29

[Simpson’s Rule][simpson] is a more accurate method of numerical integration
than the method illustrated above. Using Simpson’s Rule, the integral of a
function $f$ between $a$ and $b$ is approximated as

$$
\frac{h}{3}(y_0 + 4y_1 + 2y_2 + 4y_3 + 2y_4 + \cdots + 2y_{n-2} + 4y_{n-1} + y_n)
$$

where $h = (b-a)/n$, for some even integer $n$, and $y_k = f(a + kh)$.
(Increasing $n$ increases the accuracy of the approximation.)

Define a procedure that takes as arguments $f$, $a$, $b$, and $n$ and returns
the value of the integral, computed using Simpson’s Rule. Use your procedure to
integrate `cube` between 0 and 1 (with $n = 100$ and $n = 1000$), and compare
the results to those of the `integral` procedure shown above.

## Answer

Unlike the `integral` procedure provided by the book, Simpson's rule result is
_exact_, because `cube` is a polynomial of 3rd degree (from wikipedia).

See `simpson-integral` in [`./higher-order-procedures.rkt`][hoc]. See also other
methods to [approximate integration][appro].

I actually was able to derive the _Trapezoidal Rule_ by myself (because I used
to learn about why integral was invented). I also can derive the _Midpoint Rule_
(the `integral` approximation formula provided in 1.3.1) easily once understood
the idea. However, Simpson's Rule is quite different.
