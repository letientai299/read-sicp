# Exercise 1.31

1. The `sum` procedure is only the simplest of a vast number of similar
   abstractions that can be captured as higher-order procedures. Write an
   analogous procedure called `product` that returns the product of the values
   of a function at points over a given range. Show how to define `factorial` in
   terms of `product.` Also use `product` to compute approximations to $\pi$
   using the formula

$$
\frac{\pi}{4} = \frac{
2\cdot
4\cdot
4\cdot
6\cdot
6\cdot
8
\cdots
}{
3\cdot
3\cdot
5\cdot
5\cdot
7\cdot
7
\cdots
}
$$

2. If your `product` procedure generates a recursive process, write one that
   generates an iterative process. If it generates an iterative process, write
   one that generates a recursive process.
