# Exercise 1.33

You can obtain an even more general version of `accumulate`
([Exercise 1.32](./1.32.md)) by introducing the notion of a _filter_ on the
terms to be combined. That is, combine only those terms derived from values in
the range that satisfy a specified condition. The resulting
`filtered-accumulate` abstraction takes the same arguments as `accumulate,`
together with an additional predicate of one argument that specifies the filter.
Write `filtered-accumulate` as a procedure. Show how to express the following
using `filtered-accumulate:`

1. the sum of the squares of the prime numbers in the interval $a$ to $b$
   (assuming that you have a `prime?` predicate already written)

2. the product of all the positive integers less than $n$ that are relatively
   prime to $n$ (i.e., all positive integers $i \lt n$ such that `GCD(i,n)=1`.)
