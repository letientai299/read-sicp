# Exercise 1.34

Suppose we define the procedure

```racket
(define (f g) (g 2))
```

Then we have

```racket
(f square)
4

(f (lambda (z) (* z (+ z 1))))
6
```

What happens if we (perversely) ask the interpreter to evaluate the combination
`(f f)`? Explain.

## Answer

`(f f)` would be evaluated to `(f 2)`, then, to `(2 2)`. At that point, the
interpreter will complain that `2` is not a procedure (unless we somehow define
`2` to be something else).
