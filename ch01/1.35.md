# Exercise 1.35

Show that the golden ratio $\varphi$ (1.2.2) is a fixed point of the
transformation $x \mapsto	1+1/x$, and use this fact to compute $\varphi$ by means
of the `fixed-point` procedure.

## Answer

The golden ratio is one of the 2 roots of $x^2 = x+1$, that means:

$$
\begin{split}
         & \varphi^2 = \varphi+1 \\
\implies & \varphi = 1 + \frac{1}{\varphi}
\end{split} \tag{1}
$$

If we define $f(x) =  1 + \frac{1}{x}$, then from $(1)$, we can see that
$\varphi$ is a fixed point of $f(x)$.
