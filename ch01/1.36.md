# Exercise 1.36

Modify `fixed-point` so that it prints the sequence of approximations it
generates, using the `newline` and `display` primitives shown in
[Exercise 1.22](./1.22.md). Then find a solution to $x^x=1000$ by finding a
fixed point of $x \mapsto log(1000)/log(x)$. (Use Schemeâ€™s primitive `log`
procedure, which computes natural logarithms.) Compare the number of steps this
takes with and without average damping. (Note that you cannot start
`fixed-point` with a guess of 1, as this would cause division by $log(1)=0$.)

## Answer

Let's first understand how can we make the connection from $x^x = n$ (here,
$n=1000$) to the the `fixed-point` procedure.

$$
\begin{split}
         & x^x      & = n                     \\
\implies & x log(x) & = log(n)                \\
\implies & x        & = \frac{log(n)}{log(x)} \\
\end{split}
$$

Thus, $x$ is the fixed point of $f(x) = \frac{k}{log(x)}$ with $k = log(n)$.

For the trivial case $n=1$

Next, we need to find a good first guess. Otherwise, `fixed-point` might crash
(if we start with 1, as hinted), or won't converge.

Note that if $x\nearrow$ ($x$ increase) then $k/log(x) \searrow$, and vice
versa. Thus, our first guess, $x_0$, should satisfy that

$$
x_0 \le \frac{k}{log(x_0)}
$$

For the special case $n = 1000$, we know that $k = log(n) \gt 1$, and the fixed
point $x_{fix} \gt 1$. So, it's safe to start with $x_0 \le \sqrt{k}$, so that
$x_0^2 \le k$, which means $x_0 \le k/x_0 \le k/log(x_0)$.

For more general case where $n \in \mathbb{R+}$, we can choose other first guess
depends on where $k$ is relatively to 0 and 1.

Below graph shows the sequence generated by `fixed-point` relative to $x^x$. We
start with $x_0 = \sqrt{log(1000)}$, and tolerante was set to 0.00001.
