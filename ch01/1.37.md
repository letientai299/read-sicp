# Exercise 1.37

1. An infinite _continued fraction_ is an expression of the form

   $$
   f = \frac{N_1}{
   D_1 + \frac{N_2}{
   D_2 + \frac{N_3}{
   D_3 + \ldots
   }}}
   $$

   As an example, one can show that the infinite continued fraction expansion
   with the $N_i$ and the $D_i$ all equal to 1 produces $1/\varphi$, where
   $\varphi$ is the golden ratio (described in 1.2.2). One way to approximate an
   infinite continued fraction is to truncate the expansion after a given number
   of terms. Such a truncation—a so-called finite continued fraction $k$-term
   _finite continued fraction_—has the form

   $$
   \frac{N_1}{
   D_1 + \frac{N_2}{
   \ddots + \frac{N_k}{
   D_k
   }}}
   $$

   Suppose that $n$ and $d$ are procedures of one argument (the term index $i$)
   that return the $N_i$ and $D_i$ of the terms of the continued fraction.
   Define a procedure `cont-frac` such that evaluating `(cont-frac n d k)`
   computes the value of the $k$-term finite continued fraction. Check your
   procedure by approximating $1/\varphi$ using

   ```racket
   (cont-frac (lambda (i) 1.0)
              (lambda (i) 1.0)
              k)
   ```

   for successive values of `k.` How large must you make `k` in order to get an
   approximation that is accurate to 4 decimal places?

2. If your `cont-frac` procedure generates a recursive process, write one that
   generates an iterative process. If it generates an iterative process, write
   one that generates a recursive process.
