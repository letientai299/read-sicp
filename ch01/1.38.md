# Exercise 1.38

In 1737, the Swiss mathematician Leonhard Euler published a memoir _De
Fractionibus Continuis_, which included a continued fraction expansion for
$e−2$, where $e$ is the base of the natural logarithms. In this fraction, the
$N_i$ are all 1, and the $D_i$ are successively 1, 2, 1, 1, 4, 1, 1, 6, 1, 1, 8,
…. Write a program that uses your `cont-frac` procedure from
[Exercise 1.37](./1.37.md) to approximate $e$, based on Euler’s expansion.
