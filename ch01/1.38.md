# Exercise 1.38

In 1737, the Swiss mathematician Leonhard Euler published a memoir _De
Fractionibus Continuis_, which included a continued fraction expansion for
$e−2$, where $e$ is the base of the natural logarithms. In this fraction, the
$N_i$ are all 1, and the $D_i$ are successively 1, 2, 1, 1, 4, 1, 1, 6, 1, 1, 8,
…. Write a program that uses your `cont-frac` procedure from
[Exercise 1.37](./1.37.md) to approximate $e$, based on Euler’s expansion.

## Answer

See `approximate-e` in
[`./higher-order-procedures.rkt`](./higher-order-procedures.rkt).

This exercise help me recognize a mistake in my `cont-frac-rec` implementation
from [Exercise 1.37](./1.37.md), which wasn't appear due to the $N_i$ and $D_i$
are a fixed value (1).

This is probably the purpose of this exercise, because the author doesn't state
any other requirements (e.g. how big is $k$ to reach a specific accuracy).

Lesson learned (for this particular case: `cont-frac`)

- Recursive solution should _loop_ from left to right (1 to k).
- Iterative solution should _loop_ from right to left (k to 1).
