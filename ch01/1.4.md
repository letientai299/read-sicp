# Exercise 1.4

Observe that our model of evaluation allows for combinations whose operators are
compound expressions. Use this observation to describe the behavior of the
following procedure:

```racket
(define (a-plus-abs-b a b)
  ((if (> b 0) + -) a b))
```

## Answer

The function is doing $a + |b|$, and it's doing that by changing the combinator
between $a$ and $b$ between $+$ and $-$ (minus) base on whether $b > 0$.

This relies on the fact that both $+$ and $-$ procedures can be treated as
data, and the `(if...)` expression can return a result.
