# Exercise 1.41

Define a procedure `double` that takes a procedure of one argument as argument
and returns a procedure that applies the original procedure twice. For example,
if `inc` is a procedure that adds 1 to its argument, then `(double inc)` should
be a procedure that adds 2. What value is returned by

```scheme
(((double (double double)) inc) 5)
```

## Answer

I consider it's a challenge to compute the result of

```racket
(((double (double double)) inc) 5)
```

Without first implementing `double`. Let's use $D(f(x))$ to denote `double`
mathematically (mostly to for convenience while typing, I can't read parens). We
will also use $f^n(x)$ to denote $f((...f(x)..))$ where $f$ is applied $n$ time.
For example, $f^3(x) = f(f(f(x)))$.

We have:

$$
D(f(x)) = f(f(x)) = f^2(x) \iff D(f) =  f^2 \tag{1}
$$

It's easy to see that $D^n(f) = f^{2^n}$ for $n \ge 1$. The trivial case when
$n=1$ is proved with $(1)$. The lemma is also true for $n>1$, because

$$
D^{n+1}(f) = D(D^n(f)) = D(f^{2^n}) =  (f^{2^n})^2 = f^{2^{n+1}}
$$

Now, we define $Inc(x) = x+1$, to denote `inc` mathematically. The provided code
can be represented as:

$$
D(D(D))(Inc) = D(D^2)(Inc) = D^4(Inc) =  Inc^{2^4} = Inc^{16}
$$

With the definition of $Inc$, we will have

$$
Inc^{16}(x) = ((x + 1) + 1) + ...) + 1 = x + 16
$$

With $x = 5$, the result would be $5+16 = 21$.

Interestingly, it's very easy to mistaken between these 2 line of code

```scheme
(((double (double double)) inc) 5) ; (a)
> 21                               ; x + 16
((double (double (double inc))) 5) ; (b)
> 13                               ; x + 8
```

$(b)$ would be interpreted as $D(D(D(Inc))) = D^3(Inc) = Inc^8$. Note the
different with how $(a)$ is interpreted above.
