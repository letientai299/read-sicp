# Exercise 1.44

The idea of _smoothing_ a function is an important concept in signal processing.
If $f$ is a function and $dx$ is some small number, then the smoothed version of
$f$ is the function whose value at a point $x$ is the average of $f(xâˆ’dx)$,
$f(x)$, and $f(x+dx)$. Write a procedure `smooth` that takes as input a
procedure that computes $f$ and returns a procedure that computes the smoothed
$f$.

It is sometimes valuable to repeatedly smooth a function (that is, smooth the
smoothed function, and so on) to obtain the $n$_-fold smoothed function_. Show
how to generate the $n$-fold smoothed function of any given function using
`smooth` and `repeated` from [Exercise 1.43](./1.43.md).
