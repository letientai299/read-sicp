# Exercise 1.45

We saw in 1.3.3 that attempting to compute square roots by naively finding a
fixed point of $y \mapsto x/y$ does not converge, and that this can be fixed by
average damping. The same method works for finding cube roots as fixed points of
the average-damped $y\mapsto x/y^2$. Unfortunately, the process does not work
for fourth roots—a single average damp is not enough to make a fixed-point
search for $y \mapsto x/y^3$ converge. On the other hand, if we average damp
twice (i.e., use the average damp of the average damp of $y \mapsto x/y^3$) the
fixed-point search does converge.

Do some experiments to determine how many average damps are required to compute
$n^{th}$ roots as a fixed-point search based upon repeated average damping of
$y \mapsto x/y^{n−1}$. Use this to implement a simple procedure for computing
$n^{th}$ roots using `fixed-point`, `average-damp`, and the `repeated` procedure
of [Exercise 1.43](./1.43.md). Assume that any arithmetic operations you need
are available as primitives.
