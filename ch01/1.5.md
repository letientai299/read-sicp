# Exercise 1.5

Ben Bitdiddle has invented a test to determine whether the interpreter he is
faced with is using applicative-order evaluation or normal-order evaluation. He
defines the following two procedures:

```racket
(define (p) (p))

(define (test x y)
  (if (= x 0)
      0
      y))
```

Then he evaluates the expression

```racket
(test 0 (p))
```

What behavior will Ben observe with an interpreter that uses applicative-order
evaluation? What behavior will he observe with an interpreter that uses
normal-order evaluation? Explain your answer. (Assume that the evaluation rule
for the special form if is the same whether the interpreter is using normal or
applicative order: The predicate expression is evaluated first, and the result
determines whether to evaluate the consequent or the alternative expression.)

## Answer

> What behavior will Ben observe with an interpreter that uses applicative-order
> evaluation?

`(p)` will be evaluated. Because it's a function that return itself, this
evaluation will loop indefinitely.

> What behavior will he observe with an interpreter that uses
> normal-order evaluation?

`(p)` won't be evaluated because the `if` is short-circuited and stop early. The
`(test...)` expression should evaluate to 0.
