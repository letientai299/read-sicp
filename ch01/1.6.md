# Exercise 1.6

Alyssa P. Hacker doesn’t see why `if` needs to be provided as a special form.
“Why can’t I just define it as an ordinary procedure in terms of `cond`?” she
asks. Alyssa’s friend Eva Lu Ator claims this can indeed be done, and she
defines a new version of `if`:

```racket
(define (new-if predicate
                then-clause
                else-clause)
  (cond (predicate then-clause)
        (else else-clause)))
```

Eva demonstrates the program for Alyssa:

```racket
(new-if (= 2 3) 0 5)
5

(new-if (= 1 1) 0 5)
0
```

Delighted, Alyssa uses `new-if` to rewrite the `square-root` program:

```racket
(define (sqrt-iter guess x)
  (new-if (good-enough? guess x)
          guess
          (sqrt-iter (improve guess x) x)))
```

What happens when Alyssa attempts to use this to compute square roots? Explain.

## Answer

Since `new-if` is not a special form, it will be handled by applicative order.
Thus, in `sqrt-iter` procedure, the 3rd argument of `new-if` will always be
evaluated before entering `new-if` body, leads to an infinite loop.
