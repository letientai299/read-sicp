# Exercise 1.9

Each of the following two procedures defines a method for adding two positive
integers in terms of the procedures `inc`, which increments its argument by 1,
and `dec`, which decrements its argument by 1.

```scheme
(define (+ a b)
  (if (= a 0)
      b
      (inc (+ (dec a) b))))

(define (+ a b)
  (if (= a 0)
      b
      (+ (dec a) (inc b))))
```

Using the substitution model, illustrate the process generated by each procedure
in evaluating `(+ 4 5)`. Are these processes iterative or recursive?

## Answer

The shape for 1st version show that it's a _recursive_ process.

```scheme
(+ 4 5)
(inc (+ (dec 4) 5))
(inc (+ 3 5))
(inc (inc (+ (dec 3) 5)))
(inc (inc (+ 2 5)))
(inc (inc (inc (+ (dec 2) 5))))
(inc (inc (inc (+ 1 5))))
(inc (inc (inc (inc (+ (dec 1) 5)))))
(inc (inc (inc (inc (+ 0 5)))))
(inc (inc (inc (inc 5))))
(inc (inc (inc 6)))
(inc (inc 7))
(inc 8)
9
```

The shape for 2nd version show that it's an _iterative_ process.

```scheme
(+ 4 5)
(+ (dec 4) (inc 5))
(+ 3 6)
(+ (dec 3) (inc 6))
(+ 2 7)
(+ (dec 2) (inc 7))
(+ 1 8)
(+ (dec 1) (inc 8))
(+ 0 9)
9
```

Note how the 1st version call itself in a **nested** computation, while the 2nd
version call itself at the top of the computation branch, thus, enable tail call
optimization.
