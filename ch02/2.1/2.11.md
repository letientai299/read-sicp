# Exercise 2.11

In passing, Ben also cryptically comments: "By testing the signs of the
endpoints of the intervals, it is possible to break `mul-interval` into nine
cases, only one of which requires more than two multiplications." Rewrite this
procedure using Benâ€™s suggestion.

## Note

I don't like this exercise.

I wrote this before solving the exercise, thus, I'm not sure what'll be the
numbers of computation in the result. However, the `mul-interval` from the book
is definitely much more elegant than the suggested version. Beside, its
computation cost is probably not much higher than the new versions.

| Operations               | Current                   | New              |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------- | ---------------- |
| Comparison, `if`, `cond` | 3 + 3 for `min` and `max` | At least 9       |
| Multiplications          | 4                         | 2                |
| Lines of code            | 6                         | At least 20 (\*) |

\*: 1 top level `define`, 1 `cond`, 9 cases and 9 results

## Answer

Given the formula for `mul-interval`:

$$
[x_1,x_2]\times[y_1,y_2] = [min(x_1 y_1, x_1 y_2, x_2 y_1, x_2 y_2), max(x_1 y_1, x_1 y_2, x_2 y_1, x_2 y_2)]
$$

If we're not going to use $min$, $max$, we need to find those min and max values
manually. We do that by checking the signs of lower and upper bounds of each
intervals.

| $[x_1, x_2]$ | $[y_1, y_2]$ | Min       | Max       | Multiplications |
| ------------ | ------------ | --------- | --------- | --------------- |
| $[+, +]$     | $[+, +]$     | $x_1 y_1$ | $x_2 y_2$ | 2               |
| $[+, +]$     | $[-, +]$     | $x_2 y_1$ | $x_2 y_2$ | 2               |
| $[-, +]$     | $[+, +]$     | $x_1 y_2$ | $x_2 y_2$ | 2               |
| $[-, -]$     | $[+, +]$     | $x_1 y_2$ | $x_2 y_1$ | 2               |
| $[+, +]$     | $[-, -]$     | $x_2 y_1$ | $x_1 y_2$ | 2               |
| $[-, +]$     | $[-, -]$     | $x_2 y_1$ | $x_1 y_1$ | 2               |
| $[-, -]$     | $[-, +]$     | $x_1 y_2$ | $x_1 y_1$ | 2               |
| $[-, -]$     | $[-, -]$     | $x_2 y_2$ | $x_1 y_1$ | 2               |
| $[-, +]$     | $[-, +]$     | $??$      | $??$      | 4               |
