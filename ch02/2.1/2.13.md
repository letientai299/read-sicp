# Exercise 2.13

Show that under the assumption of small percentage tolerances there is a simple
formula for the approximate percentage tolerance of the product of two intervals
in terms of the tolerances of the factors. You may simplify the problem by
assuming that all numbers are positive.

## Answer

Let's define the 2 intervals in term of the centers and percentages.

$$
R_1 = x (1 \pm p_x)
$$

$$
R_2 = y (1 \pm p_y)
$$

Under the the assumption that the percentage is _small_, we can say the product
$R_1 R_2$ is equal to

$$
\begin{split}
R = R_1 R_2 = xy(1\pm p_x)(1 \pm p_y) \\
\end{split}
$$

SO

$$
\begin{split}
     && (1- p_x)(1 - p_y) &\le \frac{R}{xy} &&\le (1 + p_x)(1 + p_y) \\
\iff && 1 + p_x p_y - (p_x + p_y) &\le \frac{R}{xy} &&\le 1 + p_x p_y + (p_x + p_y) \\
\end{split}
$$

Them, it's clear that the width of $R$ is $xy(p_x + p_y)$, the approximate
percentage tolerance is $p_x + p_y$, and the exact tolerance is

$$
\frac{p_x + p_y}{1 + p_x p_y}
$$
