# Exercise 2.16

Explain, in general, why equivalent algebraic expressions may lead to different
answers. Can you devise an interval-arithmetic package that does not have this
shortcoming, or is this task impossible? (Warning: This problem is very
**difficult**.)

## Answer

> Explain, in general, why equivalent algebraic expressions may lead to
> different answers

Already explained in [Exercise 2.15](./2.15.md), seemingly equivalent algebraic
expressions may not have the same meanings.

I can't. I don't know if this task is even posible. Not all formulas can be
written so that no variable is repeated. In fact, there is [an IEEE standard
(1788)][ieee-1788] ([see also](https://standards.ieee.org/ieee/1788/4431/)) for
Interval Arithmetic, started since 2008, approved by IEEE in 2015 and by ANSI
in 2016. Recall that SICP 2nd was published in 1985, this problem is definitely
not for us to solve.

I'm closing this, conclude my adventure with those interval by a beautiful quote
from [Brian Hayes][hayes] in [A Lucid Interval][lucid] (PDF, also [copied in my
repo][lucid-pdf]).

> Give a digital computer a problem in arithmetic, and it will grind away
