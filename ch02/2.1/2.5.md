# Exercise 2.5

Show that we can represent pairs of nonnegative integers using only numbers and
arithmetic operations if we represent the pair $a$ and $b$ as the integer that
is the product $2^a 3^b$ . Give the corresponding definitions of the procedures
`cons`, `car`, and `cdr`.

## Answer

The problem is description is confusing to me. After searching a while, it's
basically require us to compute $p = 2^a 3^b$ in `int-cons`, then extract $a$
and $b$ via `int-car` and `int-cdr`.

The challenge is to use only _arithmetic operations_. I'm not sure if we can use
procedures like `remainder`, `floor`, `log`, `quotient`, ... I've tried
attempted to implement a custom `remainder` using only $+$, $*$ and $>$, but
that's terrible slow. Thinking more about it, we know that $/$ and $\%$
(modulus) operations for integer are closely related:
[implement one, get the other for free](https://stackoverflow.com/a/7070383).
Since we are _allowed_ to use $/$, I blieve `remainder` must be ok to use.
