# Exercise 2.24

Suppose we evaluate the expression `(list 1 (list 2 (list 3 4)))`. Give the
result printed by the interpreter, the corresponding box-and-pointer structure,
and the interpretation of this as a tree (as in [Figure 2.6][fig-2.6]).

## Answer

The evaluation

```scheme
(list 1 (list 2 (list 3 4)))
'(1 (2 (3 4)))
```

Box and pointer (created using [sdraw][sdraw] and
[`../../utils/draw.rkt`](../../utils/)).

View it as a tree

```mermaid
flowchart
  root["(1 (2 (3 4)))"]
  root --> 1
  root --> a["(2 (3 4))"]
  a --> 2
  a --> b["(3 4)"]
  b --> 3
  b --> 4
```
