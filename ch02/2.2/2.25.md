# Exercise 2.25

Give combinations of `cars` and `cdrs` that will pick 7 from each of the
following lists:

```scheme
(1 3 (5 7) 9)
((7))
(1 (2 (3 (4 (5 (6 7))))))
```

## Answer

To minimize the modification on the input, we will use the quotation feature
(introduced in [2.3 Symbolic data][sicp-2.3]) instead of rewrite the list (e.g.
from `((7))` to `(list (list 7))`).

[sicp-2.3]: https://sarabander.github.io/sicp/html/2_002e3.xhtml#g_t2_002e3

Example 1

```scheme
(define vs '(1 3 (5 7) 9))
; using normal form of car and cdr
(cdr (car (cdr (cdr l1))))
> '(7)
; use short forms, from left to right, the order is
; C d -> a -> d -> d R
(cdaddr vs)
> '(7)
```

Example 2

```scheme
(define vs '((7)))
(caar vs)
> '(7)
```

Example 3

```scheme
(define vs '(1 (2 (3 (4 (5 (6 7)))))))
(cdr                     ; '(7)
  (cadr                  ; '(6 ...)
    (cadr                ; '(5 ...)
      (cadr              ; '(4 ...)
        (cadr            ; '(3 ...)
          (cadr vs)))))) ; '(2 ...)
> '(7)
```
