# Exercise 2.37

Suppose we represent vectors $\textbf{v} = (v_i$ as sequences of numbers, and
matrices $\textbf{m}= (m_{i})$ as sequences of vectors (the rows of the matrix).
For example, the matrix

$$
\begin{pmatrix}
1 & 2 & 3 & 4 \\
4 & 5 & 6 & 6 \\
6 & 7 & 8 & 9 \\
\end{pmatrix}
$$

is represented as the sequence `((1 2 3 4) (4 5 6 6) (6 7 8 9))`.

With this representation, we can use sequence operations to concisely express
the basic matrix and vector operations. These operations (which are described in
any book on matrix algebra) are the following:

$$
\begin{split}
& \texttt{(dot-product v w)}     && \quad \text{return the sum } \Sigma_i v_i w_i        \\
& \texttt{(matrix-*-vector m v)} && \quad \text{return the vector } \textbf{t}           \\
&                                && \quad \text{where } t_i =  \Sigma_j m_{ij} v_j       \\
& \texttt{(matrix-*-matrix m n)} && \quad \text{return the matrix } \textbf{p}           \\
&                                && \quad \text{where } p_{ij} =  \Sigma_k m_{ik} n_{kj} \\
& \texttt{(transpace m)}         && \quad \text{return the matrix } \textbf{n}           \\
&                                && \quad \text{where } n_{ij} =  m_{ji}                 \\
\end{split}
$$

We can define the dot product as:

```scheme
(define (dot-product v w)
  (accumulate + 0 (map * v w)))
```

Fill in the missing expressions in the following procedures for computing the
other matrix operations. (The procedure `accumulate-n` is defined in
[Exercise 2.36](./2.36.md).)

```scheme
(define (matrix-*-vector m v)
  (map ⟨??⟩ m))

(define (transpose mat)
  (accumulate-n ⟨??⟩ ⟨??⟩ mat))

(define (matrix-*-matrix m n)
  (let ((cols (transpose n)))
    (map ⟨??⟩ m)))
```
