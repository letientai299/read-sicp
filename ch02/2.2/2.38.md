# Exercise 2.38

The `accumulate` procedure is also known as `fold-right`, because it combines
the first element of the sequence with the result of combining all the elements
to the right. There is also a `fold-left`, which is similar to `fold-right`,
except that it combines elements working in the opposite direction:

```scheme
(define (fold-left op initial sequence)
  (define (iter result rest)
    (if (null? rest)
        result
        (iter (op result (car rest))
              (cdr rest))))
  (iter initial sequence))
```

What are the values of

```scheme
(fold-right / 1 (list 1 2 3))
(fold-left  / 1 (list 1 2 3))
(fold-right list nil (list 1 2 3))
(fold-left  list nil (list 1 2 3))
```

Give a property that `op` should satisfy to guarantee that `fold-right` and
`fold-left` will produce the same values for any sequence.

## Answer

```scheme
(fold-right / 1 (list 1 2 3))
; (op x result)
> 3/2
(fold-left  / 1 (list 1 2 3))
; (op result x)
> 1/6
(fold-right list null (list 1 2 3))
> (1 (2 (3 ())))
(fold-left  list null (list 1 2 3))
> (((() 1) 2) 3)
```

Let's use $f(x, y)$ to denotes `op`. Given a list $a, b, ... z$ We want this
result of `fold-left`

$$
f(\ldots (f(f(init, a), b)\ldots), z)
$$

to be equals with the result of `fold-right`

$$
f(a, f(b, \ldots f(z, init)\ldots))
$$

So, `op` should be [Associative][asso].
