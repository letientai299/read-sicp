# Exercise 2.43

Louis Reasoner is having a terrible time doing [Exercise 2.42](./2.42.md). His
queens procedure seems to work, but it runs extremely slowly. (Louis never does
manage to wait long enough for it to solve even the $6×6$ case.) When Louis asks
Eva Lu Ator for help, she points out that he has interchanged the order of the
nested mappings in the `flatmap`, writing it as

```scheme
(flatmap
 (lambda (new-row)
   (map (lambda (rest-of-queens)
          (adjoin-position
           new-row k rest-of-queens))
        (queen-cols (- k 1))))
 (enumerate-interval 1 board-size))
```

Explain why this interchange makes the program run slowly. Estimate how long it
will take Louis’s program to solve the eight-queens puzzle, assuming that the
program in [Exercise 2.42](./2.42.md) solves the puzzle in time $T$.

## Answer

The old code run `queen-cols` once in the outer `map`. The modified code run it
$n$ time in the inner `map`. Due to the recursive nature, time complexity of the
modified version explodes quickly at $n$ go up. I'm not sure yet about the
factor, though.
