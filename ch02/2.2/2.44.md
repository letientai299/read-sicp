# Exercise 2.44

Define the procedure `up-split` used by `corner-split`. It is similar to
`right-split`, except that it switches the roles of below and beside.

## Answer

```scheme
(define (up-split p n)
  (if (= 0 n)
      p
      (let ([smaller (up-split p (- n 1))])
        (below p (beside smaller smaller)))))
```
