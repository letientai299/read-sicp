# Exercise 2.45

`right-split` and `up-split` can be expressed as instances of a general
splitting operation. Define a procedure `split` with the property that
evaluating

```scheme
(define right-split (split beside below))
(define up-split (split below beside))
```

produces procedures `right-split` and `up-split` with the same behaviors as the
ones already defined.

## Answer

```scheme
(define (split first second)
  (define (loop p n)
    (if (= 0 n)
        p
        (let ([smaller (loop p (- n 1))])
          (first p (second smaller smaller)))))
  loop)
```
