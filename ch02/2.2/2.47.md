# Exercise 2.47

Here are two possible constructors for frames:

```scheme
(define (make-frame origin edge1 edge2)
  (list origin edge1 edge2))

(define (make-frame origin edge1 edge2)
  (cons origin (cons edge1 edge2)))
```

For each constructor supply the appropriate selectors to produce an
implementation for frames.

## Answer

[`./picture-lang.rkt`](./picture-lang.rkt)

It's cool that only the selector `edge2-frame` is different between 2
implementations

```scheme
; frame using list
(define (edge2-frame frame)
  (caddr frame))

; frame using cons
(define (edge2-frame frame)
  (cddr frame))
```
