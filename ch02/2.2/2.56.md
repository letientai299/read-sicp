# Exercise 2.56

Show how to extend the basic differentiator to handle more kinds of expressions.
For instance, implement the differentiation rule

$$
\frac{d(u^n)}{dx} = nu^{n-1} \frac{du}{dx}
$$

by adding a new clause to the `deriv` program and defining appropriate
procedures `exponentiation?`, `base`, `exponent`, and `make-exponentiation`.
(You may use the symbol `**` to denote exponentiation.) Build in the rules that
anything raised to the power 0 is 1 and anything raised to the power 1 is the
thing itself.
