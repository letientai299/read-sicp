# Exercise 2.55

Eva Lu Ator types to the interpreter the expression

```scheme
(car ''abracadabra)
```

To her surprise, the interpreter prints back quote. Explain.

## Answer

The interpreter will transform the given expression to

```scheme
(car (quote (quote abracadabra)))
```

Given that `quote` is special form, that will be evaluated further as ( the form
`<sym>` means `sym` is a symbol, and can't be evaluated further):

```scheme
(car (list (<quote> <abracadabra>)))
> 'quote
```

We can verify above understanding is correct by trying `cdr`.

```scheme
(cdr ''abracadabra)
> '(abracadabra); sublist starting with the 2nd element.
(cddr ''abracadabra)
> '(); empty list
```
