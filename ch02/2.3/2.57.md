# Exercise 2.57

Extend the differentiation program to handle sums and products of arbitrary
numbers of (two or more) terms. Then the last example above could be expressed
as

```scheme
(deriv '(* x y (+ x 3)) 'x)
```

Try to do this by changing only the representation for sums and products,
without changing the deriv procedure at all. For example, the addend of a sum
would be the first term, and the augend would be the sum of the rest of the
terms.

## Answer

First, let's understand What happen if we use curent `addend` and `augend` on
$'(+ 1 2 3)$

```scheme
(define exp '(+ x y z))
(addend exp)
> x
(augend exp)
> y
```

`augend` returns only the 2nd term. We lose information about `z`. To fix this,
we should make our representation aware of the recursive relationship of `+`.

```scheme
'(+ x y z) = '(+ x (+ y z))
```

We just need to check whether the remaining part after 1st term still contains
more than 1 element and form a sub-`sum` accordingly.

```diff
 (define (augend e)
-  (caddr e))
+  (let ([terms (cddr e)])
+    (if (pair? (cdr terms)) (cons '+ terms) (car terms))))
```

Note that we don't use `length` because that would need to walk the whole
remaining part. We rely on the knowledge that `list` is just chained `cons` end
with `null`. So, `(cdr '(a b))` is `'(b)`, still a pair (`(cons b null)`), but,
`(cdr (cdr '(a b)))`, not a pair.

We can do the same for `multiplicand`.

```diff
 (define (multiplicand e)
-  (caddr e))
+  (let ([terms (cddr e)])
+    (if (pair? (cdr terms)) (cons '* terms) (car terms))))
```

`deriv` automatically works with this new change in representation!

```scheme
(deriv '(* (* x y) (+ x 3)) 'x)
> '(+ (* x y) (* (+ x 3) y))
(deriv '(* x y (+ x 3)) 'x)
> '(+ (* x y) (* y (+ x 3)))
```
