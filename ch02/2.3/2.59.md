# Exercise 2.59

Implement the `union-set` operation for the unordered-list representation of
sets.

## Answer

```scheme
(define (union-set a b)
  (if (null? a)
      b
      (let ([x (car a)] [rest (cdr a)])
        (if (element-of-set? x b)
            (union-set rest b)
            (cons x (union-set rest b))))))
```
