# Exercise 2.60

We specified that a set would be represented as a list with no duplicates. Now
suppose we allow duplicates. For instance, the set ${1,2,3}$ could be
represented as the list `(2 3 2 1 3 2 2)`.

Design procedures `element-of-set?`, `adjoin-set`, `union-set`, and
`intersection-set` that operate on this representation.

How does the efficiency of each compare with the corresponding procedure for the
non-duplicate representation?

Are there applications for which you would use this representation in preference
to the non-duplicate one?

## Answer

```scheme
(define (element-of-set? x set)
  (cond
    [(null? set) false]
    [(equal? x (car set)) true]
    [else (element-of-set? x (cdr set))]))

(define (adjoin-set x set)
  (cons x set))

(define (intersection-set a b)
  (if (or (null? a) (null? b))
      null
      (let ([x (car a)] [rest (cdr a)])
        (if (element-of-set? x b)
            (cons x (intersection-set rest b))
            (intersection-set rest b)))))

(define (union-set a b)
  (append a b))
```

| Function           | No-dup        | Allow dup     |
| ------------------ | ------------- | ------------- |
| `element-of-set?`  | $\Theta(n)$   | $\Theta(n)$   |
| `adjoin-set`       | $\Theta(n)$   | $\Theta(1)$   |
| `intersection-set` | $\Theta(n^2)$ | $\Theta(n^2)$ |
| `union-set-set`    | $\Theta(n^2)$ | $\Theta(n)$   |

Allowing duplicate could speed up 2/4 operations. However, in practice, $n$
might be much bigger in this version than the non-dup version.

It's depend on usage rate of those operations and some estimatation on how big
is $n$, with and without duplications.
