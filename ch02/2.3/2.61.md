# Exercise 2.61

Give an implementation of `adjoin-set` using the ordered representation. By
analogy with `element-of-set?` show how to take advantage of the ordering to
produce a procedure that requires on the average about half as many steps as
with the unordered representation.

## Answer

```scheme
(define (adjoin x set)
  (let ([y (car set)])
    (cond
      [(= x y) set]
      [(> x y) (cons y (adjoin x (cdr set)))]
      [else (cons x set)])))
```
