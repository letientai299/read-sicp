# Exercise 2.62

Give a $\Theta(n)$ implementation of `union-set` for sets represented as ordered
lists.

## Answer

```scheme
(define (union a b)
  (cond
    [(null? a) b]
    [(null? b) a]
    [else
     (let ([x (car a)] [y (car b)])
       (cond
         [(= x y) (cons x (union (cdr a) (cdr b)))]
         [(> x y) (cons y (union a (cdr b)))]
         [else (cons x (union (cdr a) b))]))]))
```
