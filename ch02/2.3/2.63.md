# Exercise 2.63

Each of the following two procedures converts a binary tree to a list.

```scheme
(define (tree->list-1 tree)
  (if (null? tree)
      '()
      (append
       (tree->list-1
        (left-branch tree))
       (cons (entry tree)
             (tree->list-1
              (right-branch tree))))))

(define (tree->list-2 tree)
  (define (copy-to-list tree result-list)
    (if (null? tree)
        result-list
        (copy-to-list
         (left-branch tree)
         (cons (entry tree)
               (copy-to-list
                (right-branch tree)
                result-list)))))
  (copy-to-list tree '()))
```

1. Do the two procedures produce the same result for every tree? If not, how do
   the results differ? What lists do the two procedures produce for the trees in
   [Figure 2.16](https://sarabander.github.io/sicp/html/2_002e3.xhtml#Figure-2_002e16)?

2. Do the two procedures have the same order of growth in the number of steps
   required to convert a balanced tree with $n$ elements to a list? If not,
   which one grows more slowly?

## Answer

1. Both procedures generate the same output.

- `tree->list-1` is [inorder traversal][inorder] (left - root - right).
- `tree->list-2` is Reverse inorder (right - root - left).

[inorder]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tree_traversal#In-order,_LNR

2. `tree->list-2` is $\Theta(n)$ due to how `list` is handled in Scheme, as the
   result list are built from bottom to top.

   `tree->list-1` is much slower. Below show how many time element `1` need to
   be copied via `append`. In general, assuming the tree is balanced, then the
   height of the tree is $log_2(n)$, thus `tree->list-1` time complexity is
   $\Theta(n log (n))$.

                 /   \
               3      9
             /   \      \
           1       5     11
      1  --+
      2  ----------+
      3  -----------------+
   ```
