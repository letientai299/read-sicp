# Exercise 2.66

Implement the `lookup` procedure for the case where the set of records is
structured as a binary tree, ordered by the numerical values of the keys.

## Answer

```scheme
(define (lookup given-key set-of-records)
  (if (null? set-of-records)
      null
      (let ([record (entry set-of-records)])
        (cond
          [(equal? given-key (key record)) record]
          [(less? given-key (key record))
           (lookup given-key (left set-of-records))]
          [else
           (lookup given-key (right set-of-records))]))))
```
