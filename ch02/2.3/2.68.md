# Exercise 2.68

The `encode` procedure takes as arguments a message and a tree and produces the
list of bits that gives the encoded message.

```scheme
(define (encode message tree)
  (if (null? message)
      '()
      (append
       (encode-symbol (car message)
                      tree)
       (encode (cdr message) tree))))
```

`encode-symbol` is a procedure, which you must write, that returns the list of
bits that encodes a given symbol according to a given tree. You should design
`encode-symbol` so that it signals an error if the symbol is not in the tree at
all.

Test your procedure by encoding the result you obtained in
[Exercise 2.67](./2.67.md) with the sample tree and seeing whether it is the
same as the original sample message.

## Answer

I simplified the provided `encode` function:

- Use Racket built-in [features][pairs]: `flatten`, `map` and the special
  [`curryr`][curryr] to turn `(encode sym node)` to `(lamda (sym) (...))`
  without writing the lamda.

- Add aditional error checking

[curryr]:

```scheme
(define (huffman-encode msg tree)
  (define (encode sym node)
    (let ([left (left-node node)] [right (right-node node)])
      (cond
        [(and (leaf? node) (eq? sym (leaf-symbol node)))
         null]
        [(memq sym (huffman-symbols left))
         (cons 0 (encode sym left))]
        [(memq sym (huffman-symbols right))
         (cons 1 (encode sym right))]
        [else
         (error "unknown symbol: HUFFMAN-ENCODE" sym)])))

  (if (null? tree)
      (error "null huffman tree: HUFFMAN-ENCODE")
      (flatten (map (curryr encode tree) msg))))
```

See [`./huffman.rkt`](./huffman.rkt) for full code.
