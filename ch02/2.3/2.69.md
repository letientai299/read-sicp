# Exercise 2.69

The following procedure takes as its argument a list of symbol-frequency pairs
(where no symbol appears in more than one pair) and generates a Huffman encoding
tree according to the Huffman algorithm.

```scheme
(define (generate-huffman-tree pairs)
  (successive-merge
   (make-leaf-set pairs)))
```

`make-leaf-set` is the procedure given above that transforms the list of pairs
into an ordered set of leaves. `successive-merge` is the procedure you must
write, using `make-code-tree` to successively merge the smallest-weight elements
of the set until there is only one element left, which is the desired Huffman
tree.

(This procedure is slightly tricky, but not really complicated. If you find
yourself designing a complex procedure, then you are almost certainly doing
something wrong. You can take significant advantage of the fact that we are
using an ordered set representation.)

## Answer

```scheme
(define (generate-huffman-tree pairs)
  (define (merge nodes)
    (if (null? (cdr nodes))
        (car nodes)
        (let* ([left (first nodes)]
               [right (second nodes)]
               [meta (huffman-code-tree left right)]
               [rest (drop nodes 2)])
          (merge (huffman-adjoin-set meta rest)))))
  (merge (huffman-leaf-set pairs)))
```

Note

- We can't simply using `foldl`/`foldr` in this case, since the merged `meta`
  node might not be 1 of the 2 least weight nodes in the new set. Some solutions
  in the [Scheme Wiki](http://community.schemewiki.org/?sicp-ex-2.69) are wrong.

- I think there should be a term for _repeatedly combining the top 2 items in a
  priority queue until only 1 is left_. However, I canâ€™t find it.
