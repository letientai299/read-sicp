1. How many times is the procedure `p` applied when (sine 12.15) is evaluated?

Each time `p` is applied, the angle is keep devided for 3 until it's become not
greater than 0.1 radians. Thus, let's call `α` the number of step `p` is
applied, the `α` must be the minimum integer such that:

```
3^α*0.1 ≥ 12.15
```

Then

```
α ≥ log3(12.15 /0.1) ≅ 4.3
```

Thus, `α = 5`



2. What is the order of growth in space and number of steps (as a function of `a`)
   used by the process generated by the sine procedure when (sine `a`) is
   evaluated? 2. What is the order of growth in space and number of steps (as a
   function of `a`) used by the process generated by the sine procedure when
   (sine `a`) is evaluated?

The orrder of growth in number of steps is `Θ(log(a))` (consider that `log3(x) =
log(x) / log(3)`).

For space, the order of growth is also `Θ(log(a))`, as for each time p is
applied, the stack must be expanded to store previous value.
