# Introduction

This contains note for the introduction parts before entering chapter 1.

## Unofficial Texinfo Format

https://sarabander.github.io/sicp/html/UTF.xhtml

The content I'm reading right now has been through 3 iterations:

- Texinfo to HTML
- Still Texinfo, but with a new version that support mathematical symbols.
- Output is now using modern web tech: HTML5, MathJax, SVG, ...

I'm feel luckly that I'm can access a beautiful rendered of this book for free.
Yet, I feel bad that I've procrastinated this reading for so long.

2 major concerns:

- First

  > A computer language ... is **a novel formal medium** for **expressing ideas
  > about methodology**. Thus, programs must be **written for people to read**,
  > and only incidentally for machines to execute

- Second: the techniques used to control the intellectual complexity of large
  software systems.

> Mathematics provides a framework for dealing precisely with notions of “what
> is.” Computation provides a framework for dealing precisely with notions of
> “how to.”

> data to reflect the real structure of the world being modeled.
