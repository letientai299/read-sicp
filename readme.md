Solution as code for SICP
=========================

The book: http://sarabander.github.io/sicp/

The code is written using `#lang racket/base`. I actually don't know much about
Racket (and Scheme), just learn enough to walk thought he book. I only implement
the exercises that I found interesting and won't take so much time. For purely
mathematical problems (like 1.13), I won't type down the solution (too lazy,
also, vimwiki and markdown don't support Math well).

Study note is written using [vimwiki](https://github.com/vimwiki/vimwiki),
mostly random though, open questions and aha moments. It won't be helpful if you
plan to get knowledge from the book without read it.
